Point of this project was to have little fun and learn about Python and Evolutionary algorithms. 

This project was only for me to have fun so it doesn't have any documentation, tests, command line system or even well formatted code.

It has basic chess engine algorithms for move finding: alphaBetaAlgorithm and negaMaxAlgorithm

And by default it runs genetic algorithm (on 4 cpu cores) which uses tournament selection to find out best chess piece values. 

Winners genes of each tournament pass their genes to next tournament with some randomized mutation and loser genes are killed off.
